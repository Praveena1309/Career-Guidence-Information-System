                    According to the RBI, spending on tuition and hostel fees by Indian students studying abroad has shot up 44% in the past three years. For example, the count of Indian students studying in the US was 186,267 in 2016-17, of which approximately 15% are for undergraduate studies .While the Indian government is trying to keep up with educational facilities, Indian families these days have a lot of disposable income and don’t shy away from spending their hard-earned money as an investment to their children’s future. With the recent story of the daughter of an Indian billionaire who was studying at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, was being set up by her dad in a mansion staffed by 12 servants rather than staying in regular student accommodation, it might seem that Indians with a lot of disposable income are only opting for studies overseas, but it isn’t only these heirs of opulent families of the “Crazy Rich Asians”, but the middle class too, relying on the increasing availability of student loans , part-time jobs and scholarships to finance their education.

                    <h4>IELTS(International English Language Testing System)</h4> <div class="flash"></div>
                    <p>IELTS is an English language certification exam that is required to be taken by international candidates of countries whose native language is not English  considering studying or working in a country where English is the main language of communication. The full form of IELTS is International English Language Testing System. Most popular countries where IELTS is accepted for university admissions are UK, Australia, New Zealand, US, Canada. A lot of European countries like the Nordic countries, Germany etc. ask for the IELTS too. The exam mainly measures the ability of test-takers to communicate in the four basic language skills – listening, reading, speaking, and writing.</p>
                    <p>There are two types of IELTS : Academic and General. The Academic IELTS is specially tailored for the people who wish to study in an English language institution.</p>
                    <p>Often international students are confused between choosing IELTS or TOEFL, as universities abroad ask for either exam scores. It is up to you as a test taker to decide which of the two exams to take, but remember that IELTS is more preferred in UK, Australia, and New Zealand, while TOEFL is popular among applicants to universities in US and Canada. So knowing the required average scores for US universities and average scores for Canadian universities is an important start.</p>
                    <p>IELTS isn’t compulsory in all university admissions. Many universities do not even require IELTS scores for admission purposes. But if someone don’t give the IELTS, his/her chances of getting the student visa might suffer as the visa officers may not be convinced about your English proficiency without IELTS scores. So it is safer to appear for IELTS and aim to score at least 6 bands overall.</p>
                    <p>You can take IELTS exam with the British Council or IDP up to once a week (four times a month). The British Council and IDP global schedule for test dates are 48 days per year.</p>

                    <p>The SAT is typically taken by high school juniors and seniors for admission to undergraduate courses.The SAT measures literacy, numeracy and writing skills that are needed for academic success in college, assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problems—skills they learned in school that they will need in college. However, the test is administered under a tight time limit (speeded) to help produce a range of scores.</p>
                    <p>The College Board also states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman GPA. A good performance in SAT is also said to increase the chances of getting admission to a highly ranked college and scholarships.</p>
