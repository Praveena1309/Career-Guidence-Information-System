                    <p>Construction might not seem like the job you want forever, but if you can work your way up to manager, you can earn an average of up to $1.5 million in your lifetime. The number of these jobs is expected to grow, and the median wage is over $87k per year.

There are plenty of billionaires who started off as high school dropouts. All you need is the next big thing. It wouldn’t hurt to take a few courses on the side in business management and study the practices of successful entrepreneurs you’ve read about or met. Be careful, but if you feel strongly that you can do it, it might be worth a shot.</p>
